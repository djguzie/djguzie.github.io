            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>GameChanger is a concept trading application that’s all about
              simplicity. Someone has what someone else wants, they message each
               other, work out a deal and exchange items. Trades happen in a visual
               interface allowing users to see what people have and send an offer.
               Bartering is nothing new, but giving it a focused audience, easy
               posting features, and a modern feel helps bring this ancient form
               of business into the new era.

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Games are expensive. Add to this the sheer amount of games
              released feels like a new one is here every day. On top of that,
              limited print publishers are making incredible must-own titles in
              very few quantities, with no signle database to find them all. And if
              you’re a game collector, finding physical releases of games has you deal
              with bloated prices or old antiquated web-only apps. Or worse,
              some sites use confusing currency or “credits” and dictate the
              value of your merchandise.

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>GameChanger to the rescue.</p>
            <p>The Marketplace offers plenty of filters to narrow down the
              search to that perfect game, console or collectible. The Profile
              page helps traders see what someone owns and what they want.
              Traders decide to accept offers or counter their offer from their
              Inbox. It’s also concerned with verifying users to make sure
              transactions instill trust and build a better community. Click the
              prototype to explore my concept or read below and dive a little
              deeper into how I created it.

              <h5>User Surveys</h5>
              <p>I started my project by exploring what potential users had to
                say about trading gaming items in general. I was surprised when I asked about
                whether the “App should let me make trades with
                people who live far away from me.” It wasn't as popular as I thought
                it would be. But not having to deal with shipping, Paypal, payments and the like,
                let me focus on the app's core functionality instead of finding ways to introduce a 3rd-party payment system and shipping options.</p>

              <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
              <p>I chose two game trading platforms (Leaptrade and GameTZ) as well
                as two big marketplace companies (Ebay and Craigslist) for my analysis.
                I knew that I could learn about specific niche problems with my
                first companies because they focused on the trading within the
                gaming community, while I would learn a lot about setting up
                good marketplace options from Ebay and Craigslist. In the end I
                wanted to take the simplicity of what Craigslist does, marry it
                with the gamer focus of GameTZ and Leaptrade but with a more
                modern look. </p>

                  <p>Mike works a job managing engineers at a power company.
                    Together with his wife and daughter they live in a modest home
                    which is fine for them now, but with a new baby on the way
                    they are worried about space. When he’s not doing strength
                    yoga, Mike ends up de-stressing by playing video games after
                    his daughter is asleep. Mike hopes that having the right
                    games can bring his family together.</p>
                  <h6 class="personah6">Frustrations</h6>
                  <p>Mike wants to play different games but doesn’t always know
                    titles beyond the shooters he normally plays. He wants to
                    trade, but his circle of friends all have the same games.
                    With a new baby on the way, Mike is worried buying new games
                    seems like a waste of money. He's also worried he won't be
                    able to offer much to traders since he has a big digital
                    library.</p>

                  <h6 class="personah6">Bio</h6>
                  <p>Javier works as an IT specialist at a local tech company. He lives
                    with his girlfriend in Oakland and has 2 dogs. Between his
                    job, his developer bootcamp, his girlfriend and his pets,
                    Javier stays pretty busy. With his time crunched, and wallet
                    strapped, Javier plays only a few hours a week- mostly on
                    weekends. Now that his girlfriend is playing more with him
                    he wants to find other gaming options to play together as a
                    way to spend quality time. </p>
                  <h6 class="personah6">Frustrations</h6>
                  <p> Javier doesn't like meeting people for trades because in
                    the past it has taken too long to find a suitable time and
                    place. Because he doesn't game much, he doesn't always know
                    what titles are worth having or trading for. His part-time
                    job let him buy a lot of games and he doesn't find deals on
                    physical games as often as digital ones.</p>

                  <p>Sophie is a student studying communications in Hong Kong.
                    She has a decked out gaming laptop that she uses for her
                    schoolwork and her PC gaming. She also has a collection of
                    rare toys and figurines from video game franchises she loves.
                    She likes physical media, but prefers to
                    collect digital titles because it’s the most convenient for
                    her. While PC gaming is still her favorite, her figurine
                    collection is nearing 50 characters and has recently become
                    her latest gaming obsession.</p>
                  <h6 class="personah6">Frustrations</h6>
                  <p>Sophie worries she may not find collectibles she's
                    looking for in her part of the world. She also finds it difficult
                    to trade because she can't easily find what others want to
                    receive in exchange. Sophie has had some bad experiences
                    in online gaming communities and worries this platform won't be safe.</p>

              <h5>User Stories</h5>
              <p>Attaching the data to personas, now I wanted to create tasks
                that I wanted new and returning users to accomplish. Here any
                mentions of payments, or bank accounts dropped to low priority
                since many users wanted transactions to be completed near them.
                Prioritizing these tasks helped me keep the focus of my app to
                things that were of the MOST importance. Some of the most
                important ones are highlighted below.</p>

              <p> I created a few important flows that combined what my user
              personas wanted to accomplish as well as important high priority
              items from the user stories. I found it interesting that at this
              point I created what I thought was a good flow for "Rejecting a
              Trade," but in practice I would eventually have to rethink this
              flow at the wireframe stage.</p>

                no way I could do it in Sketch or Figma.</p>

              <p>Being somewhat satisfied (let’s be honest, when is a designer
                100% satisfied 😜), I then moved on to creating the digital
                wireframes focusing on the big concepts of signing in/up,
                sending trades, countering trades, adding and deleting items for
                 trades. Select digital wireframes are shown below.</p>

              <p> I made a quick lo-fi prototype and ran some tests of the

                users thought they should press and the heatmaps were instrumental in
                implementing changes. It was particularly obvious that I needed
                to work on the Inbox page as people were clicking in all sorts of
                places.</p>

              <h5>Branding & Identity</h5>
              <p>Switching gears a bit it was time to figure out a name for my
                app. As with most projects I started with a mind map to get words
                that were tangential to the experience of games and trading.
                Pairing this with a word list I started combining one column
                with the other along with clever ideas that just came to me. The
                frontrunners at that point were:</p>
              <div class="brands">
                <ul><span class="highlights">
                  <li>- Bartur</li>
                  <li>- Faire</li>
                  <li>- Shwap</li>
                  <li>- Square Deal</li>
                  <li>- GameChanger</li></span>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>I thought they were all decent names, but GameChanger felt like
                 it could immediately be heard and recognized as a game trading
                 platform. It was also a clever play on words because users would
                 literally exCHANGE GAMEs. There’s also the concept of being a
                 “gamechanger” or something that changes the progression of
                 everything else moving forward. They were powerful ideas
                 that I thought captured the essence of the app.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="logo">
              <h5>Logo</h5>
              <div class="logo-sketches">

              </div>
              <p>Once I got to drawing I kept finding myself drawing arrows on
                variations of Gs. I had other concepts that were more out there
                (why the mohawk guy!?) but I knew that there was something unique
                about the G shape and the arrows helped convey the trading aspect
                of the platform. Because GameChanger is all about an exchange, I
                was inspired by arrows designs that centered around this idea.</p><br>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>Many of my first digital ideas involved arrows and
                stylized Gs. </p><br>
              <div class="logo-examples">
                  <img src="images/gamechanger-logo1.png" alt="logo 1">

              </div>
              <p> Even with all those ideas and I didn't quite have a logo that conveyed
                trading and could stand as a logomark. The biggest issue was that
                if the logomark is part of the logotype that could limit its use.
                Deterred, but not defeated I went back to the drawing board and
                focused on simpler shapes like a circles for the logomark. I was
                looking for inspiration in other logos like Mastercard and also
                the GQ logo. Starting with 2 circles I played around with some
                arrow concepts until I landed on the current version of the
                GameChanger Logo. Check out the animation below for a final look.
              <div class="before-after">
                <img src="images/gamechanger-logo-animation.gif" alt="gamechanger logo animation">
              </div>
              <p> The final logo is simple, conveys trading, and works well on
                its own. I always thought that logo design involved a lot of
                intense drawing, but I've found that the simplest logos work best.
                I've also created a lockup featuring a logotype using
                the Gasalt typeface with slightly altered x-height. </p>

              <h5> Color & Typography</h5>
              <p> Creating a bold, gamer-centered marketplace I decided on a
                mostly black interface with a monochrome palette to give the app
                a modern, sleek feel. But if GameChanger was going to
                be bold, I needed a bold color. I chose red as its signature color
                because it demands attention, without doing much. If I’m being
                honest, it’s also a subtle homage to Nintendo, which uses red as
                its main color and many of my users told me they supported Nintendo
                as a company more than any other brand.  Varying shades of red were
                also chosen to support the monochromatic color scheme.</p>
              <img class="colors" src="images/gamechanger-colors1.png" alt="gamechanger colors">
              <p> I have been looking for ways to find a good serif font as a
                headline and thought this may be a good time to try. I eventually
                narrowed down my choices to 4 options each with a unique contrasting
                typeface. Usability Hub helped me create a user test but I had no
                clear winner for a favorite so I decided to choose the typeface that
                best represented GameChanger- bold and slightly playful. The ligatures
                of Raleway made me think of a serif font, but it was still a sans
                serif with a slight boldness to it. I decided to stick to one family
                because font pairing seemed too forced when I tried a few combonations.

                revisions. I was always glad I made it when I had questions

              <h5>High Fidelity Mockups</h5>
              <p>One of the biggest changes from early versions of the mockups
                to later versions involved the way users add items to their trading
                list. Originally I created a large button that floated on top of
                the Profile page. It's trendy, eye-catching and I thought there's no
                better way to catch someone’s attention than a big, red "+" symbol. And while yes
                it was eye catching, something about it always felt a bit off in comparison to the rest of the design.
                I worked on a way to keep this visible but also stay true to
                GameChanger’s look. I shrunk the size of the “+” and placed it
                within a rectangle along with text indicating what pressing it
                would do.
              </p>

              <h5>User Testing</h5>
              <p>Finishing the mockups I went to test some of the usability
                using Maze. To my surprise it looks like I still hadn’t
                solved my Inbox issue. See my first version and its heatmap below.</p>
              <div class="mockup-wrapper">
                <div class=mockupconcept>
                  <img src="images/gamechanger-counterofferv1.png" alt="inbox v1">
                  <figcaption>Inbox v1</figcaption>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>You can see the heatmap for the Inbox screen had too many hotspots
                and my users were confused with this page. I reordered items,
                changed font weights, added some spacing and created a better way to show a
                new message. Shown below is the revised Inbox page as well as its
                heatmap showing users consistently clicking the proper area to
                check their new message. Data now helps me say confidently that
                I improved usability here.</p>

            <h4>What I've Learned</h4>
            <p>Looking back at the original problem I think GameChanger would be
              a worthy app to help gamers find what they want for no money out
              of pocket. I know that an app with no clear path to build revenue
              seems very idealistic, but some of the biggest apps of today
              started like that (Twitter and Facebook come to mind). They found
              ways to monetize only after they had millions of users who wanted
              their product. Thinking about it that way, users could potentially
              pay to spotlight their trade items or be alerted when particular
              items are available. It would be an easy way to monetize a part of
              the experience, completely optional, while maintaining a free core
              user experience for everyone else.

              <br><br>
              If I had more time I would like to build out a few screens of how
              to verify a user. Related to this, it would be nice to show a few
              screens on how someone would rate a user after a successful
              transaction. Verification was one of the most important features
              for users according to survey responses.  I think I showed where I
              was going with that idea, but given more time I could show exactly
              what that would look like. Building a community takes dedicated
              members and all the big marketplace apps have some form of review
              or validation. I know that with those screens built, I could
              convey the important community aspects of the platform and help
              build a safe and trustworthy space.<br><br>
