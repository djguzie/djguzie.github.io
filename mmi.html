            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>This was my first contracted UX opportunity for a client. Finally a real
              product that actually exists! I worked with the design team at
              <a href="https://shionstudio.com"> Shion Studio </a> to revamp, modernize
              and organize content for an ad-fraud detection company. The
              final version of their site is light-years ahead of were they used to be. It's modern,
              a delight to use, and most importantly easier to navigate. As a bonus, I also worked to
              deploy this site and made some final tweaks to make sure it was ready
              to launch.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="problem">
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p> Advertising is big business and when bots trick advertisters into
              thinking they have millions of views when its really only thousands,
              that hurts a company's bottom line. Given MMI has such a powerful
              product, their website did not reflect this. Their site was wordy,
              hard to navigate and had no design concept. My task was to reorganize
              the content and streamline the experience by creating solid mockups.
              This was further complicated becuase the client
              did not employ in-house web developers and so they needed a site designed
              around Squarespace templates for easy use. Working within the limited
              templates of Squarespace was a big worry for Shion as this constraint
              was a new endeavor for them.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="solution">
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>The final site gives Method Media Intelligence a much needed facelift
              entering this new decade. Their stiff and unintersting website now had a
              strong navy color to anchor softer shades of turquoise and baby blue.
              The most relevant items are on the navigation bar while less important
              details were moved to the footer. Nearly all of the copy was reworded
              and I made catchier headlines to pique people's interest. Long areas of text
              are shortened and broken up with impactful imagery and designs. More emphasis
              was placed on getting prospective clients to request a demo and so
              far there has been more interest in this area. The clients were quite
              happy with the site and I can't wait to show you how it all came together.

              <h5>User Personas</h5>
              <p>Since the turnaround was so short for this project, I didn't have
                the luxury to preform the resarch like I would have wanted to.
                Luckily, MMI was quite certain about their target market and that
                helped shape the information the site would cover. According to the
                client brief, the user likely know a lot about the ad-space, was in
                marketing and would not be confused by terms like IVT detection or
                acronyms like pii. I built a user persona based on this data and some
                other assumptions to make sure my design decisions always considered
                the target population.

                    "people person" and enjoys talking to clients on the phone in lieu of emails.
                    Recently, he has noticed some data he has for his campaigns show high engagement,
                    but the returns are smaller than the previous quarter.

                  <h6 class="personah6">Frustrations</h6>
                  <p>When looking at a website, Steven will get overwhelemed when there is too much text on a page
                  and is a fan of keeping things neat and tidy. He doesn't trust the
                  data he sees from certain campaigns as certain CTRs (click through rates)
                  are high but don't produce the intended results. He is interested
                  in preventing ad fraud, but is slightly hesitant to do so as he knows his company
                  is small and will likely push back if the cost is high.

              and my Shion Studio Design Manager's feedback, I created a list of the biggest usability

                <ul>
                  <li> The navigation bar has <strong>too many options</strong> making it
                  difficult to focus on the important content</li>
                  <li> Some items from the navigation bar would benefit from being in a <strong>footer</strong> or being
                  collapsed into somewhere else</li>
                  <li> Long sections of text could be improved by using <strong> strong imagery
                  </strong>and <strong> grouping content better</strong></li>
                  <li> The content itself could use some help to provide <strong>attention grabbing headlines</strong>
                  that encourage discovery</li>
                  <li> The website had only one opportunity to scheudle a demo so an <strong> increase in calls to action </strong>
                  would help to allow for MMI to capture more leads easily</li>
                  <li> The design of the site felt limp, and uninteresting and needs a <strong>more appealing, modern and

              that could benefit from reorganizing. Key in this new version would be a
              footer, where secondary content like the GDPR and Privacy Policy can live.
              This also has the benefit of creating a clear and focused navigation
              which helps users focus on the content. In addition, I wanted more
              opportunities for users to request information and set
              up demos with MMI. Nearly every page in the sitemap got a facelift,
              except for the FAQ which didn't change much. Compare the original and revised sitemaps below.</p>

              <p> Shion Studio entrusted me to not only build wireframes for their client, but also
              to reorganize and improve the copy of the site. What was important
              for me was to put the right amount of text, in the right parts. I also left
              room for imagery that would help balance these new sections with interesting
              content. For instance, here's a snippet of the first h1 someone would

              <p>Being somewhat satisfied (let’s be honest, when is a designer
                100% satisfied 😜), I then moved on to creating the digital
                wireframes focusing on the big concepts of signing in/up,

              <p> I made a quick lo-fi prototype and ran some tests of the
                basic features of the app. Using Maze's tests with heatmaps of all clicks and taps, I was able to see where my
                users thought they should press and the heatmaps were instrumental in
                implementing changes. It was particularly obvious that I needed
                to work on the Inbox page as people were clicking in all sorts of
                places.</p>

              <h5>Branding & Identity</h5>
              <p>Switching gears a bit it was time to figure out a name for my
                app. As with most projects I started with a mind map to get words
                that were tangential to the experience of games and trading.
                Pairing this with a word list I started combining one column
                with the other along with clever ideas that just came to me. The
                frontrunners at that point were:</p>
              <div class="brands">
                <ul><span class="highlights">
                  <li>- Bartur</li>
                  <li>- Faire</li>
                  <li>- Shwap</li>
                  <li>- Square Deal</li>
                  <li>- GameChanger</li></span>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>I thought they were all decent names, but GameChanger felt like
                 it could immediately be heard and recognized as a game trading
                 platform. It was also a clever play on words because users would
                 literally exCHANGE GAMEs. There’s also the concept of being a
                 “gamechanger” or something that changes the progression of
                 everything else moving forward. They were powerful ideas
                 that I thought captured the essence of the app.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="logo">
              <h5>Logo</h5>

              <p>Once I got to drawing I kept finding myself drawing arrows on
                variations of Gs. I had other concepts that were more out there
                (why the mohawk guy!?) but I knew that there was something unique
                about the G shape and the arrows helped convey the trading aspect
                of the platform. Because GameChanger is all about an exchange, I
                was inspired by arrows designs that centered around this idea.</p><br>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>Many of my first digital ideas involved arrows and
                stylized Gs. </p><br>
              <div class="logo-examples">
                  <img src="images/gamechanger-logo1.png" alt="logo 1">

              </div>
              <p> Even with all those ideas and I didn't quite have a logo that conveyed
                trading and could stand as a logomark. The biggest issue was that
                if the logomark is part of the logotype that could limit its use.
                Deterred, but not defeated I went back to the drawing board and
                focused on simpler shapes like a circles for the logomark. I was
                looking for inspiration in other logos like Mastercard and also
                the GQ logo. Starting with 2 circles I played around with some
                arrow concepts until I landed on the current version of the
                GameChanger Logo. Check out the animation below for a final look.
              <div class="before-after">
                <img src="images/gamechanger-logo-animation.gif" alt="gamechanger logo animation">
              </div>
              <p> The final logo is simple, conveys trading, and works well on
                its own. I always thought that logo design involved a lot of
                intense drawing, but I've found that the simplest logos work best.
                I've also created a lockup featuring a logotype using
                the Gasalt typeface with slightly altered x-height. </p>

              <h5> Color & Typography</h5>
              <p> Creating a bold, gamer-centered marketplace I decided on a
                mostly black interface with a monochrome palette to give the app
                a modern, sleek feel. But if GameChanger was going to
                be bold, I needed a bold color. I chose red as its signature color
                because it demands attention, without doing much. If I’m being
                honest, it’s also a subtle homage to Nintendo, which uses red as
                its main color and many of my users told me they supported Nintendo
                as a company more than any other brand.  Varying shades of red were
                also chosen to support the monochromatic color scheme.</p>
              <img class="colors" src="images/gamechanger-colors1.png" alt="gamechanger colors">
              <p> I have been looking for ways to find a good serif font as a
                headline and thought this may be a good time to try. I eventually
                narrowed down my choices to 4 options each with a unique contrasting
                typeface. Usability Hub helped me create a user test but I had no
                clear winner for a favorite so I decided to choose the typeface that
                best represented GameChanger- bold and slightly playful. The ligatures
                of Raleway made me think of a serif font, but it was still a sans
                serif with a slight boldness to it. I decided to stick to one family
                because font pairing seemed too forced when I tried a few combonations.

                Digital Branding Guide was a lot of fun and despite the constant
                revisions. I was always glad I made it when I had questions

              <h5>High Fidelity Mockups</h5>
              <p>One of the biggest changes from early versions of the mockups
                to later versions involved the way users add items to their trading
                list. Originally I created a large button that floated on top of
                the Profile page. It's trendy, eye-catching and I thought there's no
                better way to catch someone’s attention than a big, red "+" symbol. And while yes
                it was eye catching, something about it always felt a bit off in comparison to the rest of the design.
                I worked on a way to keep this visible but also stay true to
                GameChanger’s look. I shrunk the size of the “+” and placed it
                within a rectangle along with text indicating what pressing it
                would do.

              <p>You can see the heatmap for the Inbox screen had too many hotspots
                and my users were confused with this page. I reordered items,
                changed font weights, added some spacing and created a better way to show a
                new message. Shown below is the revised Inbox page as well as its
                heatmap showing users consistently clicking the proper area to
                check their new message. Data now helps me say confidently that
                I improved usability here.</p>

            <h4>What I've Learned</h4>
            <p>Looking back at the original problem I think GameChanger would be
              a worthy app to help gamers find what they want for no money out
              of pocket. I know that an app with no clear path to build revenue
              seems very idealistic, but some of the biggest apps of today
              started like that (Twitter and Facebook come to mind). They found
              ways to monetize only after they had millions of users who wanted
              their product. Thinking about it that way, users could potentially
              pay to spotlight their trade items or be alerted when particular
              items are available. It would be an easy way to monetize a part of
              the experience, completely optional, while maintaining a free core
              user experience for everyone else.

              <br><br>
              If I had more time I would like to build out a few screens of how
              to verify a user. Related to this, it would be nice to show a few
              screens on how someone would rate a user after a successful
              transaction. Verification was one of the most important features
              for users according to survey responses.  I think I showed where I
              was going with that idea, but given more time I could show exactly
              what that would look like. Building a community takes dedicated
              members and all the big marketplace apps have some form of review
              or validation. I know that with those screens built, I could
              convey the important community aspects of the platform and help
              build a safe and trustworthy space.<br><br>
