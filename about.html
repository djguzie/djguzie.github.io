          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Back when I was a 5th grade teacher, one of the lessons that I remember the most was teaching the 50 states and capitals. Memorization was not everyone’s forté, so I decided to break up the task into smaller chunks. With the students that that still had trouble, I broke up the learning goals even more. After a few weeks, I was able to get most of my class to pass the tests. This helped me learn that not every problem can be taken head on. Much like creating a multi-step user flow,  I  knew that breaking up a complex task into manageable chunks would be more fruitful than trying to memorize all 50 states at once.<br><br>

          A few years later I had stepped away from classroom teaching, but still found myself refining lessons- this time at an Apple store. Having done my fair share of setups I noticed some people consistently got stuck at the same points in the setup process. A screen would teach them one way to interact with the device and then change this process on the next. Unable to change the software I helped people look for ways the software was showing them how to continue. Knowing now what I know about the UX process - user testing these few screens would have proven invaluable. This data would have allowed me to change my prototype to make sure different users could move on without any issues.<br><br>

          And while during the day I worked, at night I was a full-time DJ and music producer. After some time I began to DJ less and had less. At work, I didn’t express my creativity and that coupled with my schedule led to a drastic decline in my desire to make music. I knew I needed a creative outlet to help me stay balanced, so I looked at options that could afford me creativity but also a career. A friend I had mentioned that I look into UX and within a few clicks of a web search I knew that’s what I wanted to do. I had the perfect way to show my ingenuity and problem solving in one amazing career. I could take my vast experiences helping people achieve their goals and use design principles to translate that into digital products. I have been dedicated to becoming a UX Designer ever since and I look forward to creating products people love to use.<br><br>
