          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Today memes, gifs, and funny videos, are their own unique form of
          communication. And while Silicon Valley heatedly exchanges
          spreadsheets and documents for the big meeting, millions of
          other people share a silly picture becuase it's Throwback Thursday.
          The goal of this project is to bridge the usability and ease of
          cloud storage with all the intersting ways people communicate.

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Through my survey research and interviews, I found that some people
            found their cloud storage options daunting. They associated these apps
            as more "businessy". They also didn't think they could see a benefit
            from them since they didn't use file storage daily. When I dove a bit
            deeper I found that they did in fact use and send files daily, but
            they didn't consider memes or gifs "files". They stockpiled them in
            their text conversations, photo library and social media, but these
            places made it hard to find the right file when they needed it the most.

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Enter Stash.</p>
          <p>Stash was created to store and organize the files people share and
          store the most- pictures, gifs, memes, videos or anything else they
          care about. It's easy to use, approachable and never takes itself too
          seriously. It organizes content automatically or allows users to
          do it for themselves. It's a modern solution for the even more modern
          problem of having too much stuff.

            <h4>User Surveys</h4>
            <p>I created a user survey to determine what frustrates cloud storage users
              and what they enjoy about the service. I also wanted to see if there was
              something I could salvage from their current offerings, while potentially
              discovering an unmet need.

                <li>60% of surveyed users state “Easy to Use” as their top reason
                for using their cloud storage app</li>
                <li>83% of users value “Uploading Files” and “Category Organization”
                as the most important feature for cloud storage</li>
                <li>“Content Creation” ranked last in features users would enjoy</li>
                <li>Almost half of survey partcipants state they hardly use cloud storage
                outside of work </li>
                <li>Nearly one fourth of participants stated they didn't use cloud storage

            <h4>Competetive Analysis</h4>
            <p>The competitive analysis was also instrumental in uncovering
              opportunities for my cloud storage application. Dropbox is too
              enterprise focused, Google Drive has privacy concerns and Pinterest
              although simple to use, does not support all file types. Using my
              competitive analysis along with user survey data, I was able to combine
              the best features of existing cloud storage, address their opportunities
              and create an ideal solution: an approachable, easy to use application
              that helped users categorize and upload their files. Until this point
              I still believed I was creating a humdrum file storage application…
              but this would soon change.</p>

            <p>Now that my app had a series of broad features, it was time to

              <p>Chloe lives on her mobile device and relies on it for constant
                communication with her friends. She loves Instagram and Snapchat
                but stays away from iCloud. She often communicates with images,
                gifs and memes with her friends that she saves from the internet.
                But when it comes time to reply, sometimes she can’t find the
                right file and ends up downloading or screenshotting the same
                content over again. She recieves daily messages about her
                storage being almost full.</p>
              <h6>Frustrations</h6>
              <p>Chloe is stressed from the daily chore of making space in her
                phone because she takes too many screenshots. She is also weary
                of storage applications. Often she is forgetful of where a file
                is becuase she has to look in many places to find it.</p>

                week.  He would love to date more, but given his time commitments
                in other areas and his career aspirations, he doesn’t currently
                have the bandwidth.</p>

            <p>Once the personas were fleshed out, I created some user stories

              I made them clickable and created the first working version. I
              conducted remote and in-person user tests that helped shaped
              future iterations. One of the big takeaways from these tests was
              that the flow for sharing and collaborating was nearly identical
              and somewhat confusing. Humbled by the tests, I condensed that
              flow into one process that could be either shared or collaborated
              easily and wouldn’t confuse my users.</p>

            <h4>Branding & Identity</h4>
            <p>Once I hit the branding phase, the app really began to take
              shape. I started my branding sketches focusing on the sharing
              aspect and drew up many logo iterations. Since this was mainly
              focused on the word “cloud,” feedback from some peers and industry
              professionals urged me to focus on the storage aspect instead,
              since users seemed to gel with this concept more. I used a mind
              map, and a word association list and worked hard to create a name
              that reminded people how easy it can be to store things. Below,
              you can see how I ditched  “Breeze Bin” and “Cinch Stash” and went
              with a much simpler name: Stash. Finally my app had a name!</p>
            <img src="/css/images/stash-brandingsketches.svg">
            <div class=logoconcept>
              <img src="/css/images/stash-logoconcept1.svg">
              <figcaption>Logo Concept 1</figcaption>
            </div>
            <div class="logoconcept">
              <img src="/css/images/stash-logoconcept2.svg">
              <figcaption>Logo Concept 2</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>With both designs side by side, I made the decision to go with
              concept #2 because it’s rounded font and drawer details
              delivered on the friendly easy-going vibe I wanted for the
              brand.<br> <br> Small changes then were made to the logo to help
              tighten up the design. Below you can see slight changes to size
              and kerning of the font, spacing of the words relative to the
              drawer icon and shortening drawer width to match the length of
              the words. They may seem like tiny changes, but these litte
              details make a lasting impression that will represent the brand
              of this company for years to come.</p>
            <img src="/css/images/stash-logocompare.svg">
            <p>To get a sense of certain aspects of the color, design, voice and
              typography I created a style guide. I took care to choose a
              primary color that was common in the cloud storage space like
              navy blue, but secondary colors that made it easygoing and fun.
              I took time to focus on the voice of Stash, as this is a pivotal
              piece of what makes Stash different than other cloud storage
              companies. While competitors seize an opportunity to focus on a
              concrete goal for file storage (think collaborating for an end
              goal, completing expense reports, etc..), Stash has a much
              smaller goal: a place to store the stuff users care about so
              that they can quickly find it and share it.</p>

            <p>Rounding out the last bit of branding, I crafted a moodboard to
              establish what users should feel when they visit the site or use
              the app. Quirky and fun design inspirations helped convey the
              important emotions- joy, playfulness, and fun</p>

            <p>While the idea of Stash was good, preference testing and honest
            feedback was essential in making big changes. Users told me when
            they were confused, when they enjoyed something or when I flat out

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>I wanted to create an app that was boring, basic and was a clone of
            all the other cloud storage apps. I really did. Promise! But in the
            process of trying to doing that, I actually began to care about a
            real solution for the files that my users sent to each other.<br><br>
            The biggest inspiration came from my own life and realizing that my
            girlfriend although she said she did not need cloud storage used her
            photo library and social media accounts to compile funny images to
            send me. This process was cumbersome and she was not a daily user of
            any of the big cloud storage companies. Another big inspiration was
            social media as it seems that people share, screenshot and show each
            other files more often- when was the last time someone close to you
            sent you a spreadsheet that wasn’t work-related?<br><br>
            If given more time I’d like to be able to make some of the sharing
            aspects more ironed out. I focused a lot on the user persona of the
            tech-averse person, but there is plenty of room to add functionality
            for more robust sharing and collaboration. I also wanted to create a
            place for comments once content was shared with someone. I
            envisioned a quasi-social media space for files shared that could
            create and spark even more conversation and shares. However my
            biggest regret was not making this a mobile app. I have a few
            mockups for a homepage and sign in, but given the social aspect of
            sharing and how often people have their mobile devices with them, a
            fully-featured mobile version makes the most sense.<br><br>
            It was important to me to help people like my girlfriend and many
            others, who use their devices to interact with those they care about.
            While the client had specific ideas about collaboration, potential
            users I surveyed had very different ideas about what they wanted out
            of an app like this. I hope in the future I can help companies better
            understand their users so that the products fit the user, and not
            expecting the user to conform to how companies envision their product.</p>
