            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Memes, gifs, and funny videos, are their own unique form of
            communication. And while Silicon Valley heatedly exchanges
            spreadsheets and documents for the big meeting, millions of
            other people share a silly picture just becuase it's #ThrowbackThursday.
            The goal of this project was to bridge the usability and ease of
            cloud storage with all the interesting ways people communicate.

          <section class="problem">
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Through my survey research and interviews, I found that some people
              found their cloud storage options daunting. They associated these apps
              as more "businessy". They also didn't see a benefit
              from them since they didn't use file storage daily. They did however have a massive collection of images and stockpiled them in
              their text conversations, photo library and social media, but these
              places made it hard to find the right file when they needed it the most.

          <section class="solution">
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Enter Stash.</p>
            <p>Stash was created to store and organize the files people share the most often- pictures, gifs, memes, videos and anything else they
            care about. It's easy to use, approachable and never takes itself too
            seriously. It organizes content automatically or allows users to
            do it for themselves. It's a modern solution for the even more modern
            problem of having too much stuff.

              <h5>User Surveys</h5>
              <p>I created a user survey to determine what frustrates cloud storage users
                and what they enjoy about the service. Not to be left out, I also wanted to get the opinions of cloud storage averters. I hypothesized that the reasons they stay away from these services could be addressed if there was the right appeal for them.</p>

              <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
              <p>The competitive analysis was instrumental to my process. Dropbox was
                too enterprise focused, Google Drive is bloated with features and Pinterest
                although simple to use, does not support all file types. I imagined
                an app with the cool factor of Pinterest, but features more like Dropbox
                and Google Drive. Taking account of the research so far, I was able to combine
                the best features of existing cloud storage, address their opportunities
                and create an ideal solution: an approachable, easy to use application
                that helped users categorize and upload all their files without much effort.</p>

                  <p>Chloe practically lives on her mobile device and relies on it for constant

                    gifs and memes with her friends that she saves from the internet.
                    But when it comes time to reply, sometimes she can’t find the
                    right file and ends up downloading or screenshotting the same
                    content over again. She recieves daily messages about her

                    of storage applications which have let her down in the past. Often she is frustrated
                    becuase she has to look in many places to find a particular file.</p>

                    tasks organized. When he gets home, he often doesn't have time to cook, so he
                    loves the convenience of food delivery apps and orders it several times a
                    week.  His personal life usually falls second to his work life, and he falls through on his committments to friends. </p>

                I made them clickable and created the first working version. I
                conducted remote and in-person user tests that helped shaped
                future iterations. One of the big takeaways from these tests was
                that the flow for sharing and collaborating was nearly identical
                and somewhat confusing. Humbled by the tests, I condensed that
                flow into one process that could be either shared or collaborated
                easily and wouldn’t confuse my users.</p>

              <p> I started my branding sketches focusing on the sharing
                aspect. This led to my first few sketches which led me to the name "Ever Share." With feedback from peers and industry
                professionals, they weren't in love with the idea and it was a little to close to a competitor's name. They suggested I focus on the storage aspect instead,
                since users seemed to gel with this concept more. I used a mind
                map, and a word association list and worked hard to create a name
                that reminded people how easy it can be to store things. Below,
                you can see how I ditched  “Breeze Bin” and “Cinch Stash” and went
                with a much simpler name: Stash. It's a great feeling when you land on a name and it just fits.</p>

              <p>From my inital sketches, I really enjoyed the drawer concept and created two slightly different versions. With both designs side by side, I made the decision to go with
                concept #2 because it’s rounded font and drawer details
                delivered on the friendly easy-going vibe I wanted for the
                brand.</p><br>
              <div class="logo-wrapper">
                <div class=logoconcept>

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>Small changes then were made to the logo to help
                tighten up the design. Most notably the logo font size
                and kerning, spacing of the words relative to the
                drawer icon and shortening drawer width to match the length of
                the words. They may seem like tiny changes, but these litte
                details make a lasting impression that will represent the brand
                of this company for years to come.</p><br>

              <p>To get a sense of certain aspects of the color, design, voice and
                typography I created a style guide. I took care to choose a
                primary color that was common in the cloud storage space like
                navy blue, but secondary colors that made it easygoing and fun.
                I took time to focus on the voice of Stash, as this is a pivotal
                piece of what makes Stash different than other cloud storage
                companies. While competitors seize an opportunity to focus on a
                concrete goal for file storage (think collaborating for an end
                goal, completing expense reports, etc..), Stash has a much
                smaller goal: a place to store the stuff users care about so
                that they can quickly find it and share it.</p>

              <p>Rounding out the last bit of branding, I pieced together a moodboard to
                establish what users should feel when they visit the site or use
                the app. Quirky and fun design inspirations helped convey the
                important emotions- joy, playfulness, and fun</p>

              <h5>User Testing</h5>
              <p>At this point it was time to put rubber to the road and create
                high fidelity mockups. I ran user tests in person and remotely
                to gather data on its usability. The first version of Stash was
                 too sparce and its scale was a little out of proportion. I was also a
                 bit inconsistent with my use of color. One partcipant gave feedback
                 about notices and their positioning, and how it was too obtrusive.
                 I implemented changes to my prototype and incorporated their
                 feedback to create the app Stash is today.
                 I provided some before and after images to give you an idea of
                 how the design process evolved over time.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I'll be honest. At first, this project was going to be a simple clone of other
              cloud storage apps. But in the
              process of trying to doing that, I actually began to care about a
              real solution for the files that my users sent to each other.
              So many files and images are going back and forth so quickly that while conversations
              are more visually interesting, they are also taking up much more space on our devices.
              It feels good to create a solution that takes into account our current
              communication landscape.
              <br><br>
              If given more time I’d like to be able to make some of the sharing
              aspects more ironed out. There is plenty of room to add functionality
              for more robust sharing and collaboration. I also wanted to create a
              place for comments once content was shared with someone. I
              envisioned a quasi-social media space for files shared that could
              create and spark even more conversation and shares. However my
              biggest regret was not making this a mobile app. I have a few
              mockups for a homepage and sign in, but given the social aspect of
              sharing and how often people have their mobile devices with them, a
              fully-featured mobile version makes the most sense.<br><br>
              It was important to me to help people like my girlfriend and many
              others, who use their devices to interact with those they care about.
              While the project brief had specific ideas about collaboration, potential
              users I surveyed had very different ideas about what they wanted out
              of an app like this. I hope in the future I can help companies create products
              that put their users first.</p>
