            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Memes, gifs, and funny videos, are their own unique form of
            communication. And while Silicon Valley heatedly exchanges
            spreadsheets and documents for the big meeting, millions of
            other people share a silly picture becuase it's #ThrowbackThursday.
            The goal of this project is to bridge the usability and ease of
            cloud storage with all the interesting ways people communicate.

          <section class="problem">
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Through my survey research and interviews, I found that some people
              found their cloud storage options daunting. They associated these apps
              as more "businessy". They also didn't think they could see a benefit
              from them since they didn't use file storage daily. When I dove a bit
              deeper I found that they did in fact use and send files daily, but
              they didn't consider memes or gifs "files". They stockpiled them in
              their text conversations, photo library and social media, but these
              places made it hard to find the right file when they needed it the most.

          <section class="solution">
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Enter Stash.</p>
            <p>Stash was created to store and organize the files people share the most- pictures, gifs, memes, videos or anything else they
            care about. It's easy to use, approachable and never takes itself too
            seriously. It organizes content automatically or allows users to
            do it for themselves. It's a modern solution for the even more modern
            problem of having too much stuff.

              <h5>User Surveys</h5>
              <p>I created a user survey to determine what frustrates cloud storage users
                and what they enjoy about the service. I also wanted to see if there was
                something I could salvage from their current offerings, while potentially
                discovering an unmet need.

              <p>The competitive analysis was also instrumental in uncovering
                opportunities for my cloud storage application. Dropbox is too
                enterprise focused, Google Drive has privacy concerns and Pinterest
                although simple to use, does not support all file types. Using my
                competitive analysis along with user survey data, I was able to combine
                the best features of existing cloud storage, address their opportunities
                and create an ideal solution: an approachable, easy to use application
                that helped users categorize and upload their files. Until this point
                I still believed I was creating a humdrum file storage application…
                but this would soon change.</p>

                  But when it comes time to reply, sometimes she can’t find the
                  right file and ends up downloading or screenshotting the same

                images with a focus on simplicity. Once the wireframes were done,
                I made them clickable and created the first working version. I
                conducted remote and in-person user tests that helped shaped
                future iterations. One of the big takeaways from these tests was
                that the flow for sharing and collaborating was nearly identical
                and somewhat confusing. Humbled by the tests, I condensed that
                flow into one process that could be either shared or collaborated
                easily and wouldn’t confuse my users.</p>

              <h5>Branding & Identity</h5>
              <p>Once I hit the branding phase, the app really began to take
                shape. I started my branding sketches focusing on the sharing
                aspect and drew up many logo iterations. Since this was mainly
                focused on the word “cloud,” feedback from some peers and industry
                professionals urged me to focus on the storage aspect instead,
                since users seemed to gel with this concept more. I used a mind
                map, and a word association list and worked hard to create a name
                that reminded people how easy it can be to store things. Below,
                you can see how I ditched  “Breeze Bin” and “Cinch Stash” and went
                with a much simpler name: Stash. Finally my app had a name!</p>
              <img src="images/stash-brandingsketches.svg">
              <div class="logo-wrapper">
                <div class=logoconcept>
                  <img src="images/stash-logoconcept1.svg">
                  <figcaption>Logo Concept 1</figcaption>
                </div>
                <div class="logoconcept">

                </div>
              </div>
              <p>With both designs side by side, I made the decision to go with
                concept #2 because it’s rounded font and drawer details
                delivered on the friendly easy-going vibe I wanted for the
                brand.<br> <br> Small changes then were made to the logo to help
                tighten up the design. Below you can see slight changes to size
                and kerning of the font, spacing of the words relative to the
                drawer icon and shortening drawer width to match the length of
                the words. They may seem like tiny changes, but these litte
                details make a lasting impression that will represent the brand
                of this company for years to come.</p>

              </div>
              <p>To get a sense of certain aspects of the color, design, voice and
                typography I created a style guide. I took care to choose a
                primary color that was common in the cloud storage space like
                navy blue, but secondary colors that made it easygoing and fun.
                I took time to focus on the voice of Stash, as this is a pivotal
                piece of what makes Stash different than other cloud storage
                companies. While competitors seize an opportunity to focus on a
                concrete goal for file storage (think collaborating for an end
                goal, completing expense reports, etc..), Stash has a much
                smaller goal: a place to store the stuff users care about so
                that they can quickly find it and share it.</p>

              <p>Rounding out the last bit of branding, I crafted a moodboard to
                establish what users should feel when they visit the site or use
                the app. Quirky and fun design inspirations helped convey the
                important emotions- joy, playfulness, and fun</p>

              <p>While the idea of Stash was good, preference testing and honest
              feedback was essential in making big changes. Users told me when
              they were confused, when they enjoyed something or when I flat out
              missed the mark. Their feedback helped create significant changes.</p>

                <h6>User Test Highlights</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added colored navigation bar on homepage to create some
                    variety to the mostly white design</li>
                  <li>Created more visually interesting graphics based on some
                    users saying design was “too simple”</li>
                  <li>Described some key features of Stash on homepage because some
                    users didn’t quite understand what Stash did</li>
                  <li>Shortened the size of the footer because it was quite large
                    in comparison to the header</li>
                  <li>Changed the placement of some of the navigation links to
                    put more focus on sign in and sign up buttons</li>
                  <li>Used color and placement more strategically to better highlight
                    calls to action, error states and notifications</li>
                  <li>Made a less obtrusive notification banner that appeared at
                    the top of the page instead of the middle of the page</li>
                  <li>Shrunk the sidebar and changed its color to maintain
                    consitency across landing page and the dashboard</li>
                  <li>Created more ways for users to change how they view their
                    content in the dashboard</li>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>I wanted to create an app that was boring, basic and was a clone of
              all the other cloud storage apps. I really did. Promise! But in the
              process of trying to doing that, I actually began to care about a
              real solution for the files that my users sent to each other.<br><br>
              The biggest inspiration came from my own life and realizing that my
              girlfriend although she said she did not need cloud storage used her
              photo library and social media accounts to compile funny images to
              send me. This process was cumbersome and she was not a daily user of
              any of the big cloud storage companies. Another big inspiration was
              social media as it seems that people share, screenshot and show each
              other files more often- when was the last time someone close to you
              sent you a spreadsheet that wasn’t work-related?<br><br>
              If given more time I’d like to be able to make some of the sharing
              aspects more ironed out. I focused a lot on the user persona of the
              tech-averse person, but there is plenty of room to add functionality
              for more robust sharing and collaboration. I also wanted to create a
              place for comments once content was shared with someone. I
              envisioned a quasi-social media space for files shared that could
              create and spark even more conversation and shares. However my
              biggest regret was not making this a mobile app. I have a few
              mockups for a homepage and sign in, but given the social aspect of
              sharing and how often people have their mobile devices with them, a
              fully-featured mobile version makes the most sense.<br><br>
              It was important to me to help people like my girlfriend and many
              others, who use their devices to interact with those they care about.
              While the client had specific ideas about collaboration, potential
              users I surveyed had very different ideas about what they wanted out
              of an app like this. I hope in the future I can help companies better
              understand their users so that the products fit the user, and not
              expecting the user to conform to how companies envision their product.</p>
